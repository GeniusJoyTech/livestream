### ✨ Broadcaster Installation & Configuration (100% Automático - November 26, 2025)
A instalação do broadcaster é completamente automática - **sem nenhuma entrada interativa**:

**Único Método de Instalação:**
1. Acesse o painel do dono (owner dashboard)
2. Crie um novo broadcaster
3. Clique em "📥 Baixar broadcaster_config.json" para baixar o arquivo pré-configurado
4. Coloque o arquivo na pasta `~/.simplificavideos/` no computador de destino
5. Execute: `python Broadcaster.py` (sem argumentos!)
6. Na primeira conexão, o token de instalação é automaticamente trocado por token permanente (60 dias)
7. A configuração é atualizada com as credenciais permanentes e o broadcaster_id

**Execuções Subsequentes:**
1. Simplesmente execute: `python Broadcaster.py`
2. Toda a configuração é lida automaticamente do arquivo JSON
3. Nenhuma entrada interativa é necessária - nunca!

**Detalhes Técnicos:**
- O arquivo de configuração baixado inclui: token de instalação, URL do servidor, metadados
- Token de instalação (24h) é trocado por token permanente (60 dias) na primeira conexão
- Broadcaster ID é gerado pelo servidor e permanece constante para o computador
- URL do servidor é preservada entre renovações de token
- Nome do computador é atualizado no banco em cada conexão (permite renomear)
- Se o arquivo de configuração não existir, o Broadcaster.py mostra instruções claras de como configurar

### Getting Started
1. The application is now running and accessible via the Replit webview
2. Access the login page at `/login/login.html` (automatically redirected from root)
3. Register a new account at `/register/register.html` - first user becomes admin
4. Each owner manages their own broadcasters and viewers (multi-tenant isolation)
5. Database schema is automatically initialized on startup
6. All dependencies are installed via npm

### User Registration Model
- **Open registration**: Anyone can create an owner account
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Each owner is isolated and manages only their resources
- **Owner capabilities**: Create broadcasters, add viewers, grant permissions
- **Security**: SQL-level filtering prevents cross-tenant data access

### Environment Variables
- `JWT_SECRET`: Stored in Replit Secrets (for JWT token generation)
- `FIRST_ADMIN_SECRET`: Stored in Replit Secrets (for admin registration verification)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Replit PostgreSQL database (configured in Replit Secrets)
- `PORT`: Defaults to 5000

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a login interface, a viewer interface, and a Python-based broadcaster. The viewer interface includes a responsive side-by-side layout for video and real-time activity monitoring, with fullscreen video support.

### Technical Implementations
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **WebSocket**: `ws` library for real-time communication.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with `bcrypt` for password hashing. Production environment uses Supabase PostgreSQL for user management, role-based access, and strong password enforcement.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with WebRTC API for peer-to-peer connections.
- **Broadcaster**: Python application (desktop) for screen/camera capture, idle detection, active URL tracking, and application monitoring using system APIs (`psutil`, `win32gui`). It sends monitoring data and browser history.
- **Data Storage**: In development, JSON files were used for activity and browser history. For production, a Supabase PostgreSQL database is integrated for all data persistence, including activities, browser history, user management, and audit logs.
- **Excel Export**: `ExcelJS` library for generating activity and browser history reports.

### Feature Specifications
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebRTC peer-to-peer connections with dynamic broadcaster lists and signaling via WebSockets.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication for viewers and protected API routes. Production features role-based access (owner/viewer), secure user registration, and permission-based broadcaster access.
- **Activity Monitoring**:
    - Real-time application/window status on the broadcaster's computer.
    - User idle time detection based on mouse/keyboard activity.
    - Active URL tracking from browser window titles (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    - Browser history tracking (proof of concept, not production-ready due to security concerns).
- **Data Persistence**: Activity and browser history data are stored. In production, this is handled by PostgreSQL with audit logging and a 90-day data retention policy.
- **Reporting**: Export activity and browser history data to Excel, including statistics, detailed logs, and date range filtering.
- **Connection Management**: Heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health, auto-reconnection for viewers, and health checks for peers.

### System Design Choices
- **Modularity**: Backend structured with separate files for server, WebSocket setup, handlers, services, and routes.
- **Security Focus (Production)**: Migration to Supabase PostgreSQL, implementation of strong password requirements, owner/viewer roles, audit logging, and secure broadcaster token system.
- **Scalability**: Designed with an eventual migration to a robust database (PostgreSQL) in mind for data durability and performance.
